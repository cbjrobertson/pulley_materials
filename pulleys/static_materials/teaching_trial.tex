% Below this comment is a  function calculates an arc around a circle and is used to run ropes over a pulley. It takes 5 arguments  as follows:
%	\centerarc(<X_cordinate>, <Y_coorinate>)(<Start_angle>:<Finish_angle>:<Radius), i.e. it plots a circal segment for a cirlce of <Radius>around 
% around a centre at X, Y from <Start_angle> to <Finish_angle>.
% In these diagrams, it is used mostly to draw ropes running over pulleys
\def\centerarc[#1](#2)(#3:#4:#5){\draw[#1] ($(#2)+({#5*cos(#3)},{#5*sin(#3)})$) arc (#3:#4:#5);}

			% The folloing l3 lines define a pulley. The large cicle (radius = 1) is the pulley wheel, which turns around the small circle (radius = 0.1). The
